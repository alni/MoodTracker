This app was developed to be used as a tool with **Cognitive Behavioural Therapy** to log how the mood of the patient had been during the week.

Stores data for the last week (last 7 days). The currently stored dataset can be viewed in an overview graph when pressing the select button.

## How to use it ##

1. Each day open the app from the Pebble App menu
2. Log how your mood has been during the day from `0` to `10`, 
   where `0` is the worst possible mood and `10` is the best possible mood.
3. If you need to change the mood after it was logged, you can change the mood at any time during the day by repeating the 
   steps `1` - `2`. Please note that you currently cannot change the mood of past days.
4. If you want to view the mood progress during the last week, click the Select (middle) button.
    * Here you can view how the mood has changed during the last week in a overview graph.
    * You can also see the average and the median for the mood during the last week.
