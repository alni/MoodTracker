# MoodTracker
Mood Tracking for Pebble

This app was developed to be used as a tool with **Cognitive Behavioural Therapy** to log how the mood of the patient had been during the week.

Stores data for the last week (last 7 days). The currently stored data set can be viewed in an overview graph when pressing the select button.

Based on the <https://github.com/pebble-examples/feature-persist-counter/> example project.
